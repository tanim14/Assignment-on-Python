1. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
2. Write a Python program to check if a given key already exists in a dictionary.
3. Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from the user and generates a list and a tuple of those numbers.
4. Write a Python program to calculate the number of days between two dates.
5. Write a Python program to solve (x + y) * (x + y).
6. Write a Python program to compute the future value of a specified principal amount,
7. Write a Python program that removes duplicate elements from a given array of numbers so that each element appears only once and returns the new length of the array.
8. Write a Python program to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by key value.
9. Write a Python program to add key to a dictionary. Go to the editor
10. Write a Pandas program to create and display a DataFrame from a specified dictionary data

Sample Python dictionary data and list labels:
exam_data = {'name': ['Arif', 'Asir', 'Arik', 'Anis', 'Anil', 'Ashish', 'Anahi', 'Alia', 'Alvin', 'Asim'],
'score': [12.5, 9, 16.5, np.nan, 9, 20, 14.5, np.nan, 8, 19],
'attempts': [1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1],
'qualify': ['yes', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes']}
labels = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']
